# The (new new) SPP Robotics Page
I was tasked with making the new SPP Robotics website, but it felt too hard for me and others to maintain. So here's the new new one, built with [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/).

## Why did I choose Pico CSS?
My original choice was to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), because that's what I'm familiar with. But after I found out about Pico CSS and took a look, the overall syntax and style of things are a lot easier to grasp. It's literally just basic HTML, with easy-to-understand semantics.

Considering the fact that other people have to make changes to the website, I felt that this was the way forward, and would be a hell of a lot better than whatever framework-less shit we were doing before.

## How do I use it?
I'm not sure yet. I will update this section when development moves forward.

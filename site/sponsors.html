        <p>Each year, from January to April, we participate in the FRC competition series, where we build a robot from scratch to compete against other high schools worldwide. During the six-week building time, our students must design, build, wire, and program our unique robot to complete the assigned task, while also fundraising and managing our finances. With materials, registration, and travel costs, prices add up quickly, and our school does not fully cover our expenses.</p>
        <p>We are committed to being accessible to all students of all experience levels and of all socioeconomic backgrounds. With your help, we can hopefully continue to fulfill our mission and provide students with the robotics experience of a lifetime.</p>

        <p>A toaster is a small electric appliance that uses radiant heat to brown sliced bread into toast, the color caused from the Maillard reaction. It typically consists of one or more slots into which bread is inserted, and heating elements, often made of nichrome wire, to generate heat and toast the bread to the desired level of crispiness.</p>
        <h2>Pop-up toaster</h2>
        <p>In a pop-up or automatic toaster, a single vertical piece of bread is dropped into a slot on the top of the toaster. A lever on the side of the toaster is pressed down, lowering the bread into the toaster and activating the heating elements. The length of the toasting cycle (and therefore the degree of toasting) is adjustable via a lever, knob, or series of pushbuttons, and when an internal device determines that the toasting cycle is complete, the toaster turns off and the toast pops up out of the slots.</p>
        <p>The completion of toasting may be determined by a timer (sometimes manually set) or by a thermal sensor, such as a bimetallic strip, located close to the toast.</p>
        <p>Toasters may also be used to toast other foods such as teacakes, toaster pastries, potato waffles and crumpets, though the resultant accumulation of fat and sugar inside the toaster can contribute to its eventual failure.</p>
        <p>Among pop-up toasters, those toasting two slices of bread are more purchased than those that can toast four. Pop-up toasters can have a range of appearances beyond just a square box and may have an exterior finish of chrome, copper, brushed metal, or any colored plastic. The marketing and price of toasters may not be an indication of quality for producing good toast. A typical modern two-slice pop-up toaster can draw from 600 to 1200 watts.</p>
